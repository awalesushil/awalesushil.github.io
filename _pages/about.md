I am a Research Associate in the [Visual Analytics Research Group](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/research-groups-and-labs/visual-analytics) at TIB, Hannover, Germany. I'm currently working on Multimodal Information Retrieval systems. Previously, I worked as a Student Assistant in [Language Technology Group](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home.html), Universität Hamburg building an intelligent scholarly system powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP). My area of interest lies in IR, NLP, and Semantic Web technologies.

I completed my Masters in Machine Learning from [Universität Hamburg](https://master-intelligent-adaptive-systems.com/), Germany in 2023 and my Bachelors in Computer Science in 2020 from [Tribhuwan University](http://tribhuvan-university.edu.np/), Nepal.
