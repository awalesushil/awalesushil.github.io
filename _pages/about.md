I am a Master's student at Universität Hamburg, Germany enrolled in the course [Intelligent Adaptive Systems](https://master-intelligent-adaptive-systems.com/). I'm currently working as a Student Assistant in [Language Technology Group](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home.html) building an intelligent scholarly system powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP). My area of interest lies in NLP, and currently, I am focusing on Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs.

I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science in 2020 from [Tribhuwan University](http://tribhuvan-university.edu.np/), Nepal. Before joining my Master's program, I did a couple of Research Internships in NLP at [Integrated ICT](https://www.integratedict.com.np/website/) and [NAAMII](https://www.naamii.org.np/).
