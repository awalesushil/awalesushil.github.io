With the aid of AI-based tools, ARDIAS aims to recommend potential collaborators and topics to researchers. In the near future, we aim to add tools that allow researchers to communicate with each other and start new projects.",

In this study, we aim to enrich the Hindi WordNet automatically by using state-of-the-art knowledge graph completion (KGC) approaches. We pose the automatic Hindi WordNet enrichment problem as a knowledge graph completion task and therefore we modify the WordNet structure to make it appropriate for applying KGC approaches. Second, we attempt five KGC approaches of three different genres and compare the performances for the task. Our study shows that ConvE is the best KGC methodology for this specific task compared to other KGC approaches.",
